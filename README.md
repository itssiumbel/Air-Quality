# Air-Quality
---------------------------
In this project I worked with data from one of Africa's largest open data platforms "openAfrica". With the air quality in Nairobi data I build a time series model to predict PM 2.5 readings throughout the day.
-------------------------
__My steps:__
+ getting data by querying a MongoDB database;
+ preparing time series data for analysis;
+ building an ARMA model;
+ improving a model by tuning its hyperparameters.
